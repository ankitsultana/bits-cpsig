This is the top level page for BITS Pilani Competitive Programming Special
Interest Group (Winter/Spring 2018).

**Update 14 February, 2018:**

From now on, a common (for both advanced and beginners) contest will be held on
Saturday/Sunday of every week, consisting
of 8-10 problems of varying difficulty. The problem set will consist of curated
problems that we believe should help students of all levels.

A lecture will be conducted a few days after every contest to discuss the
problems of the contest. Some additional concepts may be taught in those lectures
depending upon how the class proceeds.

Moreover, a separate lecture for the Advanced track will be conducted every week.

Please check the [beginners](https://ankitsultana.com/bits-cpsig/beginners) or
[advanced](https://ankitsultana.com/bits-cpsig/advanced) sections on this website
for the schedule and announcements.
