This is the top level page for BITS Pilani Competitive Programming Special
Interest Group (Winter/Spring 2018).

There will only be advanced track this semester. The schedule
for Advanced track has been posted (it will be updated as we progress through
the semester).

The lectures will begin from 22 January, 2018. Please
check the advanced tab on this page for the schedule.

This time the sessions will be more hands on as compared to last semester.

We might also conduct frequent contests through the semester. Schedule for them will also
be posted on the advanced tab on this page. Solutions to some selected
problems will be posted on [bk2dcradle/cpsig](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/cpsig).
