## About

<!-- img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg" -->

This is the top level page for BITS Pilani Competitive Programming Special
Interest Group (Winter/Spring 2018).

There will be two tracks this time, beginner and advanced.
This time, the *plan* is to separate the sessions into checkpoints.
Each checkpoint will consist of the following:

1. First some links to resources will be shared, along with
a list of practice problems.
2. Then a few lectures will be held to either discuss those problems or build on the
resources shared.
3. This will be followed by a contest.
4. Finally a lecture will be conducted to discuss the problems of the contest.
