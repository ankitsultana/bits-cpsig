This is the top level page for BITS Pilani Competitive Programming Special
Interest Group (Winter/Spring 2018).

There will be two tracks this time, beginner and advanced. The schedule
for Advanced track has been posted (it will be updated as we progress through
the semester).

For the beginners track, the lectures will start from first week of February.
The reason is that we will post some content that the beginners would be required to
go through. So the beginners track won't really start from the very basics, but will
rather continue building on the sessions held last semester. In case you didn't attend
the sessions held last semester, you can go through the resources (that will be) posted
in the beginners section of this page. Our intention would be to take the beginners
to a level, so by the end of the semester, they will be able to follow the content
posted in the advanced section.

For the advanced track, the lectures will begin from 22 January, 2018. Please
check the advanced tab on this page for the schedule.

This time the sessions will be more hands on as compared to last semester.

We might also conduct frequent contests through the semester. Schedule for them will also
be posted on the two tabs (beginners/advanced) on this page. Solutions to some selected
problems will be posted on [bk2dcradle/cpsig](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/cpsig).
