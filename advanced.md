## Week 1 (Active)

### Lecture 1 (Finished)

Lecture 1 will be held on 22 January, 2018 (Monday) from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm
at LTC 5101.

**Prerequisites:** [DFS Order](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/16221) (Refer to
starting time, finishing time subheading). Also, it'd be great if you can go through Vanilla
Mo's Algorithm [tutorial](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/mos-algorithm/) (although it would be covered in the lecture)

**Target:** Three variations of Mo's (Vanilla, with Updates and Trees). We will be
teaching the three variations through some problems.

**Problems:** [DQUERY \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/DQUERY/),
[86D \| CF](http://codeforces.com/contest/86/problem/D),
[COT2 \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/COT2/),
[58 \| UOJ](http://uoj.ac/problem/58?locale=en),
[Tree and Coprime Queries \| HE](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/tree-and-coprime-queries/)

**Resources:**
[Vanilla Mos](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/mos-algorithm/),
[Mos on Trees](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43230),
[Mos with Updates](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/44711#comment-292040)

**Self Study:**
Since there is a holiday on 26<sup>th</sup> January, the next lecture will only be held
after a week of Lecture 1. For self study, it is recommended that you go through
Segment Trees, because it will be extensively used in the weeks to follow.
If you are unacquainted with Segment Trees, you can use
[this link](http://letuskode.blogspot.com/2013/01/segtrees.html). If you are unable to
understand from there, refer
[Quora Wiki](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tutorials-on-segment-trees).

Here is a list of standard problems involving segment trees:

* Easy Segment Tree: [RPLN \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/RPLN/),
[CSUMQ \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/CSUMQ/),
[1112 \| LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1112),
[KGSS \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/KGSS/)

* Medium Segment Tree:
[HORRIBLE \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/HORRIBLE/),
[GSS1 \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/GSS1/),
[1083 \| Histogram](http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1083),
[ORDERSET \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/ORDERSET/),
[1188 \| LightOJ](http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1188)

* Medium-Hard Segment Tree:
[1415 \| LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1415),
[1204 \| LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1204)

**Post Lecture:**

Here are the links for the problems discussed during the lecture:
[Grid of Many Xors](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-spanning-tree/practice-problems/algorithm/grid-of-many-xors-de84b766/),
[Segment Tree with GCD](http://codeforces.com/contest/914/problem/D). The problems that we discussed in relation to Mos Algorithm are already present above.

It is recommended that you at least solve DQUERY, COT2 and a few segment tree questions
before Monday, 29 January 2018, as a contest will be conducted on that day. The contest
will have both easy and hard problems, so both beginners and advanced students are
welcome to give it. The announcement for the contest will be made soon.

### Contest 1 (Upcoming)

The first contest of CPSIG will be held on Monday, 29 January 2018. The contest will
have 6-8 problems, which will range from very easy to medium-hard/hard. The problem set
should be interesting for students of all levels.

Post this contest, we will also conduct a lecture to discuss the problems of the contest.
