## Week 1 (Finished)

### Lecture 1 (Finished)

Lecture 1 will be held on 22 January, 2018 (Monday) from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm
at LTC 5101.

**Prerequisites:** [DFS Order](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/16221) (Refer to
starting time, finishing time subheading). Also, it'd be great if you can go through Vanilla
Mo's Algorithm [tutorial](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/mos-algorithm/) (although it would be covered in the lecture)

**Target:** Three variations of Mo's (Vanilla, with Updates and Trees). We will be
teaching the three variations through some problems.

**Problems:** [DQUERY \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/DQUERY/),
[86D \| CF](http://codeforces.com/contest/86/problem/D),
[COT2 \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/COT2/),
[58 \| UOJ](http://uoj.ac/problem/58?locale=en),
[Tree and Coprime Queries \| HE](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/tree-and-coprime-queries/)

**Resources:**
[Vanilla Mos](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/mos-algorithm/),
[Mos on Trees](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43230),
[Mos with Updates](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/44711#comment-292040)

**Self Study:**
Since there is a holiday on 26<sup>th</sup> January, the next lecture will only be held
after a week of Lecture 1. For self study, it is recommended that you go through
Segment Trees, because it will be extensively used in the weeks to follow.
If you are unacquainted with Segment Trees, you can use
[this link](http://letuskode.blogspot.com/2013/01/segtrees.html). If you are unable to
understand from there, refer
[Quora Wiki](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tutorials-on-segment-trees).

Here is a list of standard problems involving segment trees:

* Easy Segment Tree: [RPLN \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/RPLN/),
[CSUMQ \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/CSUMQ/),
[1112 \| LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1112),
[KGSS \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/KGSS/)

* Medium Segment Tree:
[HORRIBLE \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/HORRIBLE/),
[GSS1 \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/GSS1/),
[1083 \| Histogram](http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1083),
[ORDERSET \| SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/ORDERSET/),
[1188 \| LightOJ](http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1188)

* Medium-Hard Segment Tree:
[1415 \| LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1415),
[1204 \| LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1204)

**Post Lecture:**

Here are the links for the problems discussed during the lecture:
[Grid of Many Xors](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-spanning-tree/practice-problems/algorithm/grid-of-many-xors-de84b766/),
[Segment Tree with GCD](http://codeforces.com/contest/914/problem/D). The problems that we discussed in relation to Mos Algorithm are already present above.

It is recommended that you at least solve DQUERY, COT2 and a few segment tree questions
before Monday, 29 January 2018, as a contest will be conducted on that day. The contest
will have both easy and hard problems, so both beginners and advanced students are
welcome to give it. The announcement for the contest will be made soon.

### Long Contest 1 (Finished)

**Updated on 27 Jan 2018:** The first long contest will start on Sunday,
28 January at 9:00 a.m. The contest
will be open for three days. The problems have been taken from different OJs,
and mostly concentrate on Segment Trees and Mo's Algorithm. I'd like to thank
[Pranet Verma](https://www.facebook.com/pranet) for collecting the problems.

A lecture will be conducted to discuss the problems of this contest. Details
regarding the same will be shared soon.

Here is the contest [link](https://vjudge.net/contest/209797). You will need
to create an account on vjudge to be able to participate.

### Lecture 2 (Finished)

Lecture 2 will be held on Friday, 02 February from 8:00 p.m to 10:00 p.m. in
LTC 5101. The agenda will be to discuss the problems from Long Contest #1.
Anyone who is familiar with Segment Trees should find the class useful. You
can checkout the problems of the contest [here](https://vjudge.net/contest/209797).

**Post Lecture:**

You can find the solutions to the problems of long contest #1 on the
[github repo](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/cpsig/). There was an issue
with the solution of problem C that was discussed in the lecture, this will be
addressed in the next lecture.

## Week 2 (Finished)

### Lecture 1 (Finished)

**Post Lecture:** We discussed persistent segment trees (PSTs) in the lecture. You can use
[this blog](https://blog.anudeep2011.com/persistent-segment-trees-explained-with-spoj-problems/)
to understand PST if you weren't able to attend the class. For those who did, be advised that
the blog explains in a totally different way compared to the way PSTs were discussed in the lecture.

The problems discussed in the lecture were [MKTHNUM](http://www.spoj.com/problems/MKTHNUM/) and
[COT](http://www.spoj.com/problems/COT/). Also, for bitset, you can refer to
[this comment](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45576?#comment-302358) which discusses the
problem that was discussed in the class.

Also, don't forget to think on [CRAYON | SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/CRAYON/).
I will discuss it in the next class if needed.

**Note:** Please go through all the problems discussed so far and try to code
as many as possible. Next long contest is in a week from now, so you should have
sufficient time to do the same.

## Week 3 (Upcoming)

### Long Contest 2 (Upcoming)

The second long contest of the season will start tonight, 17 February (Saturday)
at 9:00 p.m. and will remain open until 18 February (Sunday) 11:00 p.m.
(Duration: 26 hours).

The problem set is balanced in my opinion, so I encourage everyone to give it a
shot.

Just create an account on https://vjudge.net to participate.
