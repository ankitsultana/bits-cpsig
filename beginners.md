From now on, a common contest for advanced and beginners will be hosted on vjudge.net

Moreover, every week, two lectures will be held. One on Monday, and the other on Friday.

The lecture on Monday will be for beginners, and I will be discussing problems from the
contest. The lecture may also be used to teach a concept.

## Week 1 (Upcoming)

### Long Contest 2 (Upcoming)

The second long contest of the season will start tonight, 17 February (Saturday)
at 9:00 p.m. and will remain open until 18 February (Sunday) 11:00 p.m.

The problem set is balanced in my opinion, so I encourage everyone to give it a
shot.

### Lecture 1 (Upcoming)

The first lecture for beginners will be held on 19 February 2018 (Monday) from
8:00 p.m to 10:00 p.m. The agenda will be to discuss the problems from contest 2.
I may also teach a few concepts depending upon how the class goes.

I will also take a **survey** on what the expectations of the students are, so the
following lectures/contests can be tuned accordingly.
