# Beginners

From now on, a common contest for advanced and beginners will be hosted on vjudge.net

Moreover, every week, two lectures will be held. One on Monday, and the other on Friday.

The lecture on Monday will be for beginners, and I will be discussing problems from the
contest. The lecture may also be used to teach a concept.
